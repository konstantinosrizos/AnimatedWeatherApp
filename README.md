#### Animated Weather App builded with SwiftUI

###### Hi, this is the weather app the I build from Design COde tutorial. From a beautiful UI design from Figma to a real iOS app. We have cool animations, such as the scroll parallax and the text transitions on the drag gesture. Also animated the cards with a scroll effect with the slide over when switching between the tabs of the segmented control.


###### There are custom components involved such as the tab bar, navigation bar, search bar, this bottom sheet with a stunning layer of background blur.

#### Dependecies used:
- `BottomSheet`
